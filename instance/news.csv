1,"A Guide on PCB, What is it Really?","Managing your taxes can be stressful, but Malaysia’s Potongan Cukai Bulanan (PCB), or Monthly Tax Deduction, offers a straightforward solution. This system allows employees to meet their income tax obligations gradually throughout the year, easing the burden of paying a large sum at the end of the tax period.

PCB ensures that taxes on employment income are automatically deducted from an employee’s salary every month by their employer. The employer, in turn, remits these deductions to the Inland Revenue Board (Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri, LHDN), ensuring that taxes are paid in regular, manageable amounts.

How does PCB Works? 
PCB deductions are made on a monthly basis by employers, and the amount deducted depends on the employee’s salary. This system is designed to streamline the tax-paying process, particularly for individuals whose sole source of income comes from employment. Instead of worrying about making a lump sum payment at the end of the financial year, employees can rely on the automatic deductions from their salary.

This method not only ensures that employees stay on top of their tax obligations but also minimizes the likelihood of underpayment, which can lead to penalties later on. One of the advantages of the PCB system is that, under certain conditions, it can be considered as the employee’s final tax payment. This means that individuals who meet specific criteria do not need to file an annual tax return, as their monthly PCB deductions fully cover their tax obligations.


PCB can also be considered as final tax, and for it to be eligible as one, the following conditions must be met:

1. The individual’s only source of income is from employment.
2. They have been employed by the same employer throughout the tax year.
3. Their employer has been accurately deducting PCB each month.
4. The individual’s taxes are not borne by the employer.
5. The employee is not opting for joint tax assessment with their spouse.
If any of these conditions are not met, the individual is required to file a tax return to reconcile any outstanding tax matters.

Although PCB deductions make the tax process smoother, not everyone can forgo filing a tax return. Employees whose annual income exceeds RM 34,000 after EPF deductions must file a tax return unless they qualify for the PCB as final tax exemption. Filing a tax return ensures that any additional deductions or claims can be accounted for, such as rebates, reliefs, or additional income not covered by the PCB system.

How PCB is Submitted and Paid:

Employers are responsible for managing PCB deductions and ensuring they are submitted to LHDN correctly. Several methods are available for employers to submit these deductions, including:

1. Internet Banking: Bulk payment services offered by banks such as Maybank, CIMB, and Public Bank make it easy for employers to remit employee deductions.
2. LHDN Online Portals: Employers can use LHDN’s e-PCB or e-CP39 portals to manually or electronically submit monthly deductions.
3. Payment Methods: Employers can pay online via the FPX platform using supported banks, or physically via cheque deposits at select banks. Additionally, cash payments can be made at POS Malaysia counters.

The primary benefit of the PCB system is that it simplifies the tax-paying process for both employees and employers. By deducting small amounts each month, employees avoid the financial shock of a large tax bill at the end of the year. Additionally, for those who meet the criteria, PCB serves as the final tax payment, eliminating the need for annual tax returns. This system also helps employers by automating the process of managing employee taxes. With convenient submission and payment methods, it ensures compliance with tax regulations, reducing administrative burdens and errors.

In summary, PCB is a practical solution for managing personal income tax in Malaysia. Whether you're a new employee or a seasoned professional, understanding how PCB works can help you manage your finances more effectively. By fulfilling your tax obligations throughout the year, you can avoid unnecessary stress during tax season.

If you need more detailed information on PCB or specific guidance about your tax situation, it’s recommended to visit the official LHDN website or consult with your employer’s HR department for further assistance.",Infomercial,https://www.payrollpanda.my/collections/malaysian-pcb/,pcb.png,2024-10-10 09:15:03
2,"Understanding SPC, How Important Is It?","Surat Penyelesaian Cukai (SPC), or Tax Clearance Certificate is a vital document issued by the Inland Revenue Board (Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri, LHDN). This certificate is essential for employees who are retiring, resigning, leaving Malaysia, or in the unfortunate event of death. SPC ensures that an employee’s tax obligations are settled before they are allowed to access their final salary, compensation, or retirement benefits.


SPC is typically required when an employee:

1. Resigns from their job
2. Retires
3. Plans to leave Malaysia for an extended period or permanently
4. Passes away


Employer's Responsibility:

Employers play a crucial role in the SPC process. When an employee falls under any of the situations mentioned, the employer must:

1. Submit the necessary tax forms to LHDN to notify them about the employee’s change in employment status.
  > For private-sector employees: Form CP22A
  > For government employees: Form CP22B
  > For employees leaving Malaysia: Form CP21
2. Withhold any final payments (such as salary or compensation) until the SPC is issued by LHDN. This ensures that any outstanding taxes owed by the employee are settled before their departure or retirement.
3. Employers are also required to notify LHDN at least 30 days before the employee’s last working day. For employees who pass away, the employer must notify LHDN within 30 days after being informed of the death.


How to Apply for SPC?

The process for applying for SPC can be completed in two ways:

 > Online via e-SPC: Employers can submit the necessary forms and documents through LHDN’s MyTax portal, ensuring a quicker and more convenient process.

 > Manual submission: Employers can submit the forms physically to the LHDN office handling the employee’s tax file.

Once all required documents are submitted and LHDN verifies the employee's tax records, the SPC will be processed within 10 working days.


Importance of SPC for Employees: 

For employees, obtaining an SPC is critical, especially before retiring or leaving the country. Without this document, their final payments might be delayed as employers are legally required to withhold those amounts until tax clearance is granted.

In some cases, employees may not need to go through the SPC process if:
1. Their income is already subject to Potongan Cukai Bulanan (PCB), and there are no outstanding taxes.
2. Their monthly income is below the taxable threshold, and they are not receiving any compensation upon resignation or retirement.


When LHDN receives an SPC application, they will review the employee’s tax records for any outstanding liabilities or issues. If everything is in order, they will issue the SPC to the employer, allowing the release of the final payments to the employee. In cases where taxes are owed, the amount will need to be settled before the SPC can be issued.


Penalties for Employers Who Fail to Comply: 

Employers who fail to apply for SPC when required can face legal consequences. Under the Income Tax Act 1967, employers who do not fulfill their responsibilities may be fined between RM200 to RM20,000 or face up to six months in jail. They may also be held liable for any taxes owed by the employee if they fail to withhold the necessary funds.

In conclusion, the Surat Penyelesaian Cukai (SPC) is an important part of Malaysia’s tax system, ensuring that all tax obligations are fulfilled when an employee resigns, retires, leaves the country, or passes away. Employers are legally responsible for ensuring that the SPC process is completed, while employees must ensure their tax records are up to date to avoid delays in receiving their final payments.

For more detailed information or to apply for an SPC, you can visit LHDN’s official website or access the MyTax portal.",Infomercial,https://www.hasil.gov.my/media/aoxouusj/garis-panduan_spc_individu_bil_2_2024_final.pdf,espc.png,2024-10-21 04:21:16
3,The Need of a Licensed Company Secretary in a Company.,"In Malaysia, appointing a company secretary is not just a recommendation but a legal requirement for all companies under the Companies Act 2016. This position is vital for ensuring that companies comply with regulations and maintain proper corporate governance. The company secretary plays a critical role in supporting the board of directors and facilitating the smooth operation of corporate matters.


Why Every Company Needs a Company Secretary? 

Upon incorporation, every company in Malaysia must appoint at least one company secretary within 30 days. The individual must be a natural person, aged 18 or above, and a Malaysian citizen or permanent resident residing in Malaysia. Furthermore, the company secretary must be a member of a professional body recognized by the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM), such as the Malaysian Association of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (MAICSA) or the Malaysian Bar.

The role of a company secretary extends beyond simple administrative tasks. They are the backbone of corporate compliance and governance. Some key responsibilities include:

 > Ensuring Compliance: The secretary ensures the company operates within the guidelines set by the Companies Act, which includes filing annual returns, maintaining statutory registers, and ensuring timely submission of documents to SSM.

 > Board Meetings: They are responsible for organizing board meetings, preparing agendas, and documenting the minutes to ensure that decisions made by the board are accurately recorded.

 > Annual General Meeting (AGM): Company secretaries handle the logistics of AGMs, ensuring that shareholders are informed, resolutions are properly passed, and outcomes are correctly filed with SSM.

 > Statutory Updates: They must update the statutory records of the company when there are changes, such as the appointment of new directors, change in registered address, or alterations in the company’s structure.

 > Communication: Maintaining open channels between shareholders, directors, and regulatory authorities is a key function. The company secretary ensures that information flows efficiently and that the company’s interests are well-represented.


Eligibility and Disqualifications:

To become a company secretary, an individual must meet several criteria. However, certain conditions disqualify someone from holding this position. These include being an undischarged bankrupt or having been convicted of offenses related to corporate misconduct. Additionally, if the individual’s certification from the Registrar under section 241 of the Companies Act is revoked, they cannot act as a company secretary.

A company secretary is officially appointed by the company’s board of directors. The secretary must consent in writing to their appointment. Importantly, a company is allowed to have more than one secretary if required.

Resignation of a company secretary must be done by notifying the board, and the secretary will officially vacate their position within 30 days. The board is then required to notify SSM within 14 days after the resignation. The removal of a secretary can be executed by a board resolution, provided the terms of the secretary’s appointment are followed.


Can a Director Also Be the Company Secretary?

Under specific circumstances, a director may act as a company secretary. However, section 242 of the Companies Act prohibits a single individual from acting in dual capacities when both a director and a secretary are needed to fulfill a corporate duty. This ensures that two separate persons handle different responsibilities, promoting transparency and accountability within the company.

Having a company secretary is a legal and functional necessity in Malaysia. Not only do they ensure that the company remains compliant with the law, but they also provide essential support in managing corporate governance and maintaining clear communication within the organization. Failing to appoint a company secretary can lead to legal penalties, so businesses should prioritize this role when incorporating and operating within Malaysia.

For more information on appointing a company secretary and the services they provide, companies are encouraged to reach out to professional secretarial service providers or consult SSM directly.",Infomercial,https://www.ssm.com.my/acts/fscommand/act125s0139.htm,comsec.png,2024-10-21 04:27:31

5,New E-PCB Plus System That Will be Replacing the Current System.,"Starting on 24 September 2024, the new e-PCB Plus system will officially replace the current e-PCB system used for PCB (Potongan Cukai Bulanan) calculations and submissions. This revamped system, introduced by the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (LHDNM), aims to streamline the monthly tax deduction process by integrating all PCB-related functions into a single platform, accessible via the MyTax portal. Below is a breakdown of the key features of the new system and important actions required for employers.


Phase 1 of e-PCB Plus includes several key updates:

1. Registration of Roles: Employers, Employer Representatives, and PCB Administrators must register their roles in the MyTax portal. This ensures authorized individuals can access and manage PCB-related information.
2. Updating Information: Employers will need to update and verify their employees' and their own information in e-PCB Plus.
3. Administrator Role Registration: Additional registration is needed for those handling PCB on behalf of the company, ensuring proper access control.


To access the new system, users will need to:

1. Log in to MyTax using their individual ID and password.
2. Select the relevant role (e.g., employer, representative, or administrator) to gain access to the system.
3. Follow the guidelines available in the user guide on the MyTax portal for smooth transition and setup.

The existing e-PCB system will continue functioning alongside e-PCB Plus until further notice, ensuring there is no disruption during the transition period.
